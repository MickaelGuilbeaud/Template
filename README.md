# Template

This template is both a project best practice showcase and a base to kickstart a new project faster.

## Overview

### Libraries

### Gradle

An env product flavor is present on top of the default debug and release build types. Its primary use is to define the DOMAIN_URL variable for switching the back-end domain between prod, preprod and dev.

### Modules

### Base classes

### Setup

#### Crash reporting

#### Logging

Logging is done with Timber. We initialize it to only print logs in debug builds, preventing logs in release versions.
